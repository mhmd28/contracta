##Human Resources Management via AMS
#####Source: Mohammad Mohammadieh - RSC Owner
RSC requires the ability of the Human Resources (HR) type of users to monitor the attendance of the company’s employees in order to ensure their productivity and following the company’s policy and rules.
AMS will allow HR type users to create accounts for new employees on AMS and edit them as needed. 
The account will include the personal information of the employees and their work history.
AMS will be able to provide reports to HR and management type users regarding the attendance over the period of time chosen.
AMS as a system will also send daily alerts to both HR and the management type users when the attendance average percentage of the employees on that day did not reach the percentage already set by the previously mentioned users.
####Justification
Currently, at RSC, the tracking method of the attendance requires reading through logs and checking for each employee on their own, which will take time and effort that can be avoided.
Also, the current system doesn't have the ability to provide reports that will give an indication to the discipline of the employees which will help with their evaluation eventually.
