##Project Management via PMS
#####Source: Mohammad Mohammadieh - RSC Owner
RSC requires the facility for the head of the engineer type of users to be able to create and edit project objects on the system in order to:
Assign employees(including engineers) to each project.
Monitor the project progress through snapshots.
Report problems in case of delays.
Open an investigation.
####Justification
Currently, at RSC, there is no way to track the progress of the project being executed on-site unless the head of engineers go and visit the location to check themselves, which will take time and effort that can be totally avoided by a snapshot-based system to insure the employee productivity and the project progress.
